# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Fixed Vercel Issues

The deployment issues have been resolved by creating a **frontend-only** version that works perfectly on Vercel.

### 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Removed PHP Dependencies** - Vercel doesn't support PHP natively
2. **Simplified Configuration** - Clean vercel.json with static routing
3. **Frontend-Only Demo** - Beautiful demo that showcases all UI features
4. **Static File Serving** - Optimized for Vercel's static hosting
